# SearchFile

Intended to leverage the provided data (tickets.json and users.json and organization.json) to write a simple command line application (or a locally runnable web-app) to search the data and return the results in a human readable format.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

IDE IntelliJ IDEA CE 2019.2.1
Maven apache-maven-3.6.1
java version "12.0.2" 2019-07-16

### Installing

Compile and run Main.java to interact with the main menu
Type 'quit' to exit at any time, Press 'Enter' to continue

	Select search options:
	* Press 1 to search Zendesk
	* Press 2 to view a list of searchable fields
	* Type 'quit' to exit

## Running the tests

Integration with JUnit libraries and tests were not established due to time constraints and prioritizing setup and core functionality (¯\_(ツ)_/¯).
