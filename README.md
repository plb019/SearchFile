# SearchFile

Intended to leverage the provided data (tickets.json and users.json and organization.json) to write a simple command line application (or a locally runnable web-app) to search the data and return the results in a human readable format.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

IDE IntelliJ IDEA CE 2019.2.1

Maven apache-maven-3.6.1

java version "12.0.2" 2019-07-16

### Installing

Compile and run Main.java to interact with the main menu
Type 'quit' to exit at any time, Press 'Enter' to continue

	Select search options:
	* Press 1 to search Zendesk
	* Press 2 to view a list of searchable fields
	* Type 'quit' to exit

## Running the tests

Integration with JUnit libraries and tests were not established due to time constraints and prioritizing setup and core functionality (¯\_(ツ)_/¯).

## Acknowledgments

* My husband for being ri·dic·u·lous·ly supportive (considering he had to spend the day managing the packing process of our daughter as she prepares for her departure for college tomorrow)
* Zendesk for giving me a humbling but truely valuable experience

### Description of my development journey:
- Extatic to receive word I made it to the next round
- Complete panic
- Giving up (several times)
- Getting back up, deciding even if only to supply one ounce of working code - it would be worth it.
- Brainstorm on an inital development plan
- Read, learn, try, fail, try again, succeed, repeat
- Unable to get needed functionality from simple text editor (Atom/terminal), install Eclipse (nope, not enough time for this), install IntelliJ (okay, better)
- Import existing code, make sure it compiles and runs
- Start looking at the deeper functionality to work with JSON documents
- Ran out of time, realizing that to continue inching forward I would require sacrificing family milestones
- Comment out anything that wasn't working to ensure I would have something to share
